A repo of personal .dotfiles

TODO:
  1. setup ipython configs

Iterm setup:
  1. uncheck the "Draw bold text in bright colors" from iterm to support bold colors in prompt

Steps to setup:
  1. cd ~/; wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotgc/dotfiles/master/prep.sh
  2. chmod +x prep.sh
  3. ./prep.sh


Notes:
  1. If the repo was cloned using https, change the remote url to have <username>@. This would prevent asking for username everytime. It'll still ask for password.
